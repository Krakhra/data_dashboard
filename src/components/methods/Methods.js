      <p>
        A logistic regression was used to model the proportion of electricity
        generation coming from wind and solar sources over time. Logistic regression
        uses a logistic function to create a model of binary data. Binary data is usually 
        represented by 1 for a success and 0 for a failure of whatever is being measured. In this case, 
        our binary data uses each kWh generated from solar or wind sources as success and each kWh from 
        any other source as a 0. The resulting model represents the trend of growth for the proportion of 
        electricity coming from solar and wind power generation over time.

      <p>
        In comparison to linear regression, the outcome of a logistic regression will model the dependent variable
        (y-axis) between 0 and 1. The logistic regression is more appropriate for modelling binary or proportional 
        data as these values can only exist between 0 and 1, where a linear model generates impossible values that 
        are less than 0 and greater than 1.

      <p>
        In our case for predicting wind and solar proportions, we used a 95% prediction interval (Î± = 0.05), resulting in a range of values that we can expect 95% of the actual future data to fall within.
