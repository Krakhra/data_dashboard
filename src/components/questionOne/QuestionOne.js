        This visualization shows the share of non-renewable and renewable energy production. We can see that renewable energy share is
        increasing over time.

      <p>
        Using logistic modeling we can predict what solar and wind growth rate would be late in a non-pandemic scenario
        from stats canada we have the first 2 quarters of 2020, represented as the 2 red points
        these quarters produced 25% less than the predicted production, and is possibly due to project delays due to COVID-19
